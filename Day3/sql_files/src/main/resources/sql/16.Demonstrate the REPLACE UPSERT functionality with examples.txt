1. REPLACE 
If the row doesnâ€™t exist, it inserts it.

If the row exists (based on primary key or unique index), it deletes the old row and inserts the new one.


REPLACE INTO studentDetails (studentId, courseId, email, fullName)
VALUES (1, 101, 'arjun.updated@example.com', 'Arjun Mehta Updated');

If (studentId = 1 AND courseId = 101) exists, the row is deleted and a new one is inserted.

If not, it simply inserts the new row.



2.  INSERT

Tries to insert the row.

If a duplicate key (primary or unique) exists, it will update the specified fields.

INSERT INTO studentDetails (studentId, courseId, email, fullName)
VALUES (1, 101, 'arjun.updated@example.com', 'Arjun Mehta Updated')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
email = VALUES(email),
fullName = VALUES(fullName);

If the record exists, only email and fullName are updated.

This is more controlled and safer than REPLACE.
