a) List all students along with the courses they are enrolled in.

SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID;



b) List all courses and the students enrolled in them (include courses with no enrollments).

SELECT c.CourseName, s.FirstName, s.LastName
FROM Courses c
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON c.CourseID = e.CourseID
LEFT JOIN Students s ON e.StudentID = s.StudentID;


c) Show all students who have not enrolled in any course.

SELECT s.*
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
WHERE e.EnrollmentID IS NULL;

d) List course names along with the count of enrolled students using JOIN.

SELECT c.CourseName, COUNT(e.StudentID) AS EnrolledCount
FROM Courses c
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON c.CourseID = e.CourseID
GROUP BY c.CourseName;


e) Show each student's full name and all course names they are enrolled in, ordered by student name.

SELECT CONCAT(s.FirstName, ' ', s.LastName) AS FullName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID
ORDER BY FullName;


f) List students and enrollment details using INNER JOIN.

SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, e.EnrollmentDate, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
INNER JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID;



g) List all courses with student names using LEFT JOIN.

SELECT c.CourseName, s.FirstName, s.LastName
FROM Courses c
LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON c.CourseID = e.CourseID
LEFT JOIN Students s ON e.StudentID = s.StudentID;



h) List student names and their course names using RIGHT JOIN (if supported by your DBMS).

SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
RIGHT JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
RIGHT JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID;


i) Show students and courses using FULL OUTER JOIN (if supported).

SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
FULL OUTER JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
FULL OUTER JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID;


j) Find students who are enrolled in both 'Database Systems' and 'Data Structures'.

SELECT s.StudentID, s.FirstName, s.LastName
FROM Students s
WHERE s.StudentID IN (
    SELECT e1.StudentID
    FROM Enrollments e1
    JOIN Courses c1 ON e1.CourseID = c1.CourseID
    WHERE c1.CourseName = 'Database Systems'
)
AND s.StudentID IN (
    SELECT e2.StudentID
    FROM Enrollments e2
    JOIN Courses c2 ON e2.CourseID = c2.CourseID
    WHERE c2.CourseName = 'Data Structures'
);
