1. Aggregate Functions

Students(StudentID, CourseID, FullName, Email)
Salary(EmployeeID, Amount, Month)



a) COUNT() – count total students

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
FROM Students;


b) SUM() – total salary paid

SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalSalaryPaid
FROM Salary;


c) AVG() – average salary

SELECT AVG(Amount) AS AverageSalary
FROM Salary;













2. Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY and HAVING


a. Find employees with total salary greater than ₹100000

SELECT EmployeeID, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSalary
FROM Salary
GROUP BY EmployeeID
HAVING SUM(Amount) > 100000;


b. b) Courses with more than 5 students

SELECT CourseID, COUNT(StudentID) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
GROUP BY CourseID
HAVING COUNT(StudentID) > 5;
