1. DELETE
Deletes specific rows from a table based on a condition.

Can delete all rows if no condition (WHERE) is specified.

Removes rows one by one, logging each deletion (can be slower).

Table structure and indexes remain intact.

EXAMPLE:-
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE Department = 'IT';

DELETE FROM Employee;

Business Usage:
When you want to remove some specific records (e.g., employees who left the company).

When you need to maintain the table structure and possibly reuse the table.

When deletion needs to be logged or rolled back (supported in transactions).



2.TRUNCATE


Removes all rows from a table quickly.

Resets auto-increment counters.

Cannot delete specific rows — it’s an all-or-nothing operation.

Does not log individual row deletions (much faster than DELETE).

Table structure and indexes remain intact.

EXAMPLE:-
TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;

Business Usage:
When you want to quickly clear all data from a table (e.g., clearing a staging or temporary data table).

When you want to reset the table to empty state, including auto-increment.

When transaction logging and rollback are not required or not supported for this operation.





3. DROP


Completely removes the table and its data from the database.

Removes table structure, data, indexes, triggers, constraints — everything.

Cannot be undone unless you restore from backup.

All dependent objects (like views) may break.


EXAMPLE: 

DROP TABLE Employee;


Business Usage:
When you want to permanently remove a table that is no longer needed (e.g., obsolete or temporary tables).

When you want to restructure the database schema by removing old tables.

When starting fresh or doing cleanup in development or testing environments.
